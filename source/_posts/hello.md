I haven't maintained a blog in any serious capacity perhaps ever. My "official" website, [thomaspatricklevy.com](https://thomaspatricklevy.com) is largely a list of unpublished poems and links to poems that were published on websites that mostly don't exist anymore.

I often think "You should launch a website again" and then because I'm working on websites all day long anyway the idea of launching a website exhausts me. I am a fan of WordPress but I don't want to maintain yet another WordPress site.

Every static blog generator I look at has too many new commands. Writing a custom static solution also feels like too much.

Yet, finally, I'm writing a blog post.
